#### Vision Statement:
##### Good habits are difficult to start and more difficult to keep. Even the most diligent of people struggle to form a new habit. While time and intentionality can initiate a habit, studies indicate that a pre-existing habit helps anchor a new one into disciplined practice. The “Hawthorne Effect” also shows that productivity increases when people know they are being observed. HabitBuddy provides a way for someone to start a new habit by matching them to another user(s) (aka “Buddy”) with similar goals and interests to start practicing a habit together. By matching them based on interests, HabitBuddy encourages users to associate their new habits with something they both enjoy, such as drinking hot chocolate or being outside. Unlike other habit-tracking apps, HabitBuddy allows users to form a habit alongside someone else, allowing for personable accountability. Users will be able to share their goals, track their progress, and encourage other Buddies with their newly adopted habits.
