### Vision Statement
Good habits are difficult to start and difficult to keep. Even the most diligent among us struggle to maintain healthy habits. According to James Clear's book *Atomic Habits*, the best way to begin a new habit is to anchor it to a habit or hobby you do regularly. This way, you naturally associate your new habit with something you enjoy, thus building a habit easily into your routine. And while this may be all the prompting you need to add a healthy habit to your schedule, we also know the benefits of having friendly accountability. The “Hawthorne Effect” shows us that productivity increases when people know they are being observed, so why not start a habit with someone else? 

Our mobile app, HabitBuddy, provides a way for someone to start a new habit by matching them to a Buddy. Our goal is to connect Buddies with similar goals and interests to encourage them to start a new habit together. The matching process is straightforward. On our app, each Buddy fills out a profile, where they add some basic information and a habit (or habits) they want to maintain. They also choose from a variaty of interests, such as hobbies, food, music genres. Buddies are matched based on thier profiles and go through their list of matches and choose a Buddy to connect with. Unlike other habit-tracking apps, HabitBuddy allows clients to form a habit alongside someone else, encouraging personable accountability and conversation.
