### Vision Statement
Good habits are difficult to start and difficult to keep. Even the most diligent among us struggle to maintain healthy habits. According to James Clear's book *Atomic Habits*, the best way to begin a new habit is to anchor it to a habit or hobby you do regularly. This way, you naturally associate your new habit with something you already do and enjoy, thus building a habit easily into your routine. And while this may be all the prompting you need to add a healthy habit to your schedule, we also know the benefits of having friendly accountability. The “Hawthorne Effect” shows us that productivity increases when people know they are being observed, so why not start a habit with someone else? 

Our mobile app, HabitBuddy, provides a way for someone to start a new habit by matching them to other clients, aka “Buddies”. Each Buddy fills out a profile and is matched with possible Buddies based on habits and hobbies. The goal of the match is to connect people with similar goals and interests and help them start a habit together. By matching them based on interests, HabitBuddy encourages clients to associate their new habits with something they both enjoy, such as drinking hot chocolate or being outside. Unlike other habit-tracking apps, HabitBuddy allows clients to form a habit alongside someone else, encouraging personable accountability and conversation.
