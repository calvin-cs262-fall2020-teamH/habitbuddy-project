### Vision Statement
Good habits are difficult to start and more difficult to keep. Even the most diligent of people struggle to form a new habit. While time and intentionality can initiate a habit, studies indicate that a pre-existing habit helps anchor a new one into disciplined practice. The “Hawthorne Effect” also shows that productivity increases when people know they are being observed. HabitBuddy provides a way for someone to start a new habit by matching them to another client(s) (aka “Buddy”) with similar goals and interests to start practicing a habit together. By matching them based on interests, HabitBuddy encourages clients to associate their new habits with something they both enjoy, such as drinking hot chocolate or being outside. Unlike other habit-tracking apps, HabitBuddy allows clients to form a habit alongside someone else, thus encouraging personable accountability. Clients will be able to share goals, track progress, and encourage each other through HabitBuddy.
