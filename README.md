### Vision Statement
Good habits are difficult to start and difficult to keep. Even the most diligent among us struggle to maintain healthy habits. According to James Clear's book, *Atomic Habits*, the best way to begin a new habit is to anchor it to a habit or hobby you do regularly. This way, you naturally associate your new habit with something you enjoy, thus building a habit easily into your routine. And while this may be all the prompting you need to add a healthy habit to your schedule, we also know the benefits of having friendly accountability. Clear offers the idea of starting a habit with someone who already maintains your desired habit and the “Hawthorne Effect” shows us that productivity increases when people know they are being observed, so why not start a habit with someone else? 

Our mobile app, Habit Buddy, provides a way for someone to start a new habit by matching them to another Buddy. Our goal is to connect Buddies with similar goals to encourage them to start a habit together.  And while the habit itself is important, Habit Buddy also matches people based on a common interest. The matching process is straightforward. On our app, a first-time Buddies fill out a basic profile and declare a habit(s) they want to maintain. They also choose from a variety of interests, such as hobbies, food, or music genres. Based on their profiles, Habit Buddy matches Buddies with a list of people, from which they choose a Buddy to connect with. The list will include Buddies with similar goals and even Buddies who already maintain their desired habit(s). Because Buddies are also matched based on interests, like their favourite band or salty snack, they have the ease of anchoring their new habit to their Buddy and their shared interest. While other habit-tracking apps boast motivating reminders and cool scheduling formats, Habit Buddy allows people to make a personal connection, not just with their habits, but with others who will inspire and motivate them. Buddies can encourage each other by sending messages, sharing goals and progress reports, and posting pictures.
