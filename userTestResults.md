# User Test Results
The results from each tested function:

* Share your initial thoughts.
Testers commented on the simplicity of the user interface. All liked the color scheme. A few thought the login page had too much white space. To correct this we plan on adding a background picture to help create a more pleasant first impression.

* Create an account on HabitBuddy.
All testers were able to successfully create an account with ease.

* Logout of account.
Most testers were able to logout quickly, but some found it difficult to find exactly where to logout. We plan to fix this by pulling the “logout” button out to the settings page and not have it embedded within another menu.

* Log into the sample account.
All testers were able to log into the sample account with ease.

* Edit your hobby from “Reading” to “Basketball”.
Most testers found the profile page and then clicked the edit icon and were able to make this change with ease. Some testers had minimal difficulty with locating the page, but even with this, they still quickly found how to edit profile information quickly.

* Delete the buddy with “Snowboarding” as their hobby.
Some testers deleted the buddy with snowboarding as their hobby easily. A few navigated to the buddies page instantly, but they did not see that the information presented on this screen was not their buddy’s hobby. To clear this up, we hope to add a “Tap for more details” to entice a user to click on their buddies right away and see that they can access their buddy’s profile information. 
	
* Send Dawson a reminder to complete his daily goal.
The majority of testers were able to send this text quickly. Some navigated to the correct page but found difficulty in how to send a text. In the end, all were able to find the link that directed them to their personal SMS application. One tester thought it would be helpful if there was a button rather than a link. We agree with this and depending on time, we hope to make sending a text to your buddy clearer.

* You just completed your daily goal of “Studying for 1 hour.” Log this.
A few testers were able to log the completion of their daily goal easily. Many found difficulty in navigating to the correct page. After finding the “habit tracker” page, some testers were not sure what they were supposed to do. Some found the information icon and used this to help them complete logging their daily goal. Overall, the intention of tapping the day was not clear. To fix this, we plan to add text on the “habit tracker” page that says, “tap today to log your daily goal.” We hope that this will make tracking a habit clearer.

* Find information on “Habit Stacking”.
Most testers found information on “Habit Stacking” easily. Some went looking in the about page, but all ended up finding the information on the home page.

* Change the theme of the app to “dark” mode.
All testers were able to change the theme of the app with ease. Many really liked this change and emphasized how simple and easy it was to do.

* Change your password.
All testers found how to change their password and completed it quickly. Some commented about there being no notification regarding the confirmation of a password being changed. We hope to implement this function to limit ambiguity with changing your password.

* Find the name of the book that inspired this app.
All testers were able to find the name of the book. A few had difficulty in locating where this information was, but eventually found it in the “About” page. Since this is not a pivotal part regarding the functionality of the app we plan on leaving it for now.

* Share your concluding thoughts.
All testers explained that the overall app experience was pleasant, and concluded with emphasising some of the issues they ran into throughout the test.
