### Vision Statement
Good habits are difficult to start and difficult to keep. Even the most diligent among us struggle to maintain healthy habits. According to James Clear's book, *Atomic Habits*, the best way to begin a new habit is to anchor it to a habit or hobby you do regularly. This way, you naturally associate your new habit with something you enjoy, thus building a habit easily into your routine. And while this may be all the prompting you need to add a healthy habit to your schedule, we also know the benefits of having friendly accountability. Clear offers the idea of starting a habit with someone who already maintains your desired habit and the “Hawthorne Effect” shows us that productivity increases when people know they are being observed, so why not start a habit with someone else? 

Our mobile app, Habit Buddy, provides a way for someone to start a new habit by matching them to another Buddy. Our goal is to connect Buddies with similar goals to encourage them to start a habit together. This includes matching people who want to start a habit that someone else already maintains! And while the habit itself is important, Habit Buddy also matches people based on a common interest. The matching process is straightforward. On our app, each Buddy fills out a profile, where they add some basic information and a habit (or habits) they want to maintain. They also choose from a variety of interests, such as hobbies, food, music genres. Buddies are then matched based on their profiles and go through their list of matches to choose a Buddy to connect with. Because they are also matched based on things like their favourite artist or salty snack, Buddies will have the ease of anchoring their new habit to a shared interest. While other habit-tracking apps offer motivating reminders and inspiring quotes, HabitBuddy allows people to make a personal connection, not just with their habits, but with others who will help hold them accountable. Buddies can encourage each other by sending messages, sharing goals and progress reports, and posting pictures.
